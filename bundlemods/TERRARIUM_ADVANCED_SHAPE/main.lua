-- Advanced Voxel Mod (full merge): a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as
-- a rendering pipeline mod. Base identity (manifest id, hotkey priority) is
-- ADVANCED_SHAPE's; the code underneath is TERRARIUM's fuller environment
-- feature set (weather, ecology, town life, quality-of-life), patched in
-- three places to restore ADVANCED_SHAPE behaviour TERRARIUM's fork had
-- dropped -- see manifest.json's description for the three changes, and
-- lib/HorizonArt.lua, lib/VoxelScene.lua and lib/Voxel3D.lua for where.
--
-- On top of that base, this revision restores the systems TERRARIUM's fork
-- had ALSO quietly dropped when it branched off ADVANCED_SHAPE (formerly
-- DRAMATIC_SHAPE): Horde Mode, LET'S GO capture, VR, the Stadium/player 3D
-- models, and the mod's own in-game Settings screen (lib/SettingsMenu.lua)
-- that groups every row instead of leaving them flat on the engine's
-- OPTIONS list. All of it now lives under the single ADVANCED_SHAPE letter
-- hotkey scheme rather than TERRARIUM's digit keys -- see "this mod's
-- hotkeys" below.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Nothing here reaches collision, movement, triggers or scripts.  Voxel
-- mode is purely presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.

-- lib/ modules require each other through V rather than package.path: a

-- over the same pipeline slot. That is no longer the situation here --
-- this mod ships as the only voxel pipeline installed, under
-- ADVANCED_SHAPE's own manifest id -- so the plain names are used
-- instead. This also means any ADVANCED_SHAPE-derived file that checks
-- Pipelines.level("voxel") / Pipelines.canToggle("voxel", ...) directly

    -- frame, so the sky, the hour's tint and the pond's glint all take their
    -- values from a shower that has already advanced rather than from the one
    -- before it. Ahead of the active() gate too, because a shower is a fact
    -- about Kanto and not about the camera -- it keeps building while you are
    -- in a fight, and the 2D world darkens under it either way.
    Weather.update(dt)
    -- and what the weather LEAVES: the ground soaking through a shower and
    -- drying out over the ten minutes after it, the snow settling and
    -- melting, the footprints filling back in. Immediately behind Weather,
    -- because it reads the number that call just wrote -- and ahead of the
    -- active() gate for the same reason the shower itself is: how wet the
    -- ground is is a fact about Kanto, so it keeps soaking while you are
    -- indoors, in a fight, or playing with the camera switched off.
    GroundFX.update(dt)
    -- and the air itself, made visible. BEHIND Weather, because the gust
    -- envelope it throws its fronts off is advanced by Wind.step and that
    -- call is inside Weather's tick -- reading it ahead of that would spawn
    -- every front one frame late and off the previous gust. Gated on the
    -- camera unlike the two above, and honestly so: dust blowing across a
    -- meadow is a DRAWING, not a fact about Kanto, and there is nothing for
    -- it to blow across on the flat 2D path.
    WindFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what it sounds like out there. Also ahead of the gate, and for a
    -- plainer reason than the weather's: a sound needs no camera, so the
    -- crickets come out at night on the flat 2D world too.
    AmbientSound.update(dt)
    -- The street Pokemon ride the same tick and gate themselves exactly
    -- like the wild ones do -- and like them, they are real map objects,
    -- so they walk the flat 2D world too.
    CityLife.update()
    -- and what the town DOES about the weather: when it comes down hard the
    -- civilians walk to the nearest door and stand in it, and the street
    -- Pokemon go in and are gone until it passes. Immediately BEHIND
    -- CityLife, because it drops that module's cast and sets the flag that
    -- stops it refilling the street behind them -- and behind Weather for
    -- the plainer reason that it reads the shower that call just advanced.
    Shelter.update()
    -- and what the people do the rest of the time. Behind Shelter because
    -- both write `facing` and the rain outranks a conversation: somebody
    -- walking to a door has already been taken out of the routine's hands
    -- (it skips anybody carrying `dsShelter`), and running them the other
    -- way round would spend a frame with the two disagreeing.
    Routines.update(dt)

    -- reason and gates itself the same way. Its steam is a drawing and waits
    -- for the overlay; the cat itself is standing there in both modes.

    QoL.update()
    -- how much fits in the bag, kept in step with the two rows. Polled for

-- tree that is no longer there.  The 2D tile renderer invalidates its own
-- caches off the same edit.

-- refresh, not invalidate: the stale mesh keeps drawing while the
-- replacement builds in the background, so a one-block edit (Cut, a

  GroundFX.invalidate()

-- The event above is the ANNOUNCED edit -- OverworldState:replaceBlock
-- emits it, which is the path Victory Road's barriers and a script's
-- replaceBlock take. Several edits do not go through it:
--
--   Cut          swaps the tree block and rebuilds the 2D renderer
--   the regrowth restores those blocks when the map is re-entered
--   card-key doors are stamped closed on floor load
--
-- all of them writing the block layer directly. Meshes derived from that
-- layer went stale with no announcement -- the cut tree stayed standing,
-- and after a round trip through a door the stump stayed cut because this
-- map's mesh survives in the cache (that is what prevLive is for).
--
-- The engine could announce each of those, and an earlier cut of this
-- work changed it to. That is the wrong place: it edits the game for one
-- mod's benefit, and every future path that writes a block has to
-- remember to do the same. They all funnel through ONE choke point --
-- Map:setBlock -- so wrap that from here instead. Map is a plain
-- metatable shared by every map instance, so this covers all of them,
-- including paths written after this mod.
--
-- Read back rather than trust the argument: setBlock silently ignores an
-- out-of-bounds write, and a stamp that rewrites a block with the value
-- it already held (the door code guards for this, the regrowth does not)

--
-- ON, always, with no row to switch it off: shininess is a property of the
-- Pokemon rather than a display mode, and a Pokemon that is shiny in one
-- player's save and not another's is not a Pokemon, it is a setting.
--
-- Rests on a fact the engine already ships: Gen 1 has no shininess of its
-- own, but it has the four DVs Gen 2 reads to decide it, and the engine's
-- own Stats.lua carries that reading -- "the RBY virtual shiny", there for
-- indicator mods. So nothing new is stored on a Pokemon and nothing has to
-- migrate: every save ever made already contains the answer.
--

-- ------- wild Pokemon standing in the grass
--
-- The two seams this needs -- Player:tryMove, which is where walking into
-- one is refused, and OverworldState:talkTo, which is where pressing A at
-- one lands -- live in lib/WildRoamers.lua with the reasoning for each.
--
-- Nothing here reaches the encounter TABLES: which species and how likely
-- each is are still the ROM's, read through the same records the roll reads.
-- What changes is that the roll happens in the open, some distance away,
-- and you can see its answer standing in the grass before you decide
-- whether to walk into it.
WildRoamers.install()

-- ------- Pokemon in the streets
--
-- One seam -- OverworldState:talkTo, chained behind WildRoamers' wrap of
-- the same method -- where pressing A at a street Pokemon becomes a cry
-- and a line of flavour text, or a challenge. lib/CityLife.lua holds the
-- reasoning.
CityLife.install()

-- ------- and asleep on the floor indoors

-- its own mark and passes everything else along -- where pressing A at a
-- sleeping house pet is a slowed cry and a line, and never a battle.
Interiors.install()

-- ------- what the world sounds like
--
-- Registered rather than merely built: every one of these is a Game Boy
-- channel program assembled by the engine's own authoring path
-- (src.audio.ChipAsm, one of the three src modules the loader names as a
-- supported require) and handed to the engine's own sfx registry -- so they
-- are real entries under real ids, and a sound pack can override
-- DS_AMB_CRICKET with a file of its own and be played instead. Nothing here
-- ships an audio asset; the crickets, the birds, the water, the rain and the
-- thunder are all synthesized from about two hundred bytes of note table
-- each. See lib/AmbientSound.lua for what every program is.
--
-- At load time on purpose: assembly touches no love.* at all, so it works on
-- a headless boot and in the manager's dry load, and the registry has the
-- entries before anything can ask to play one.
AmbientSound.register(mod)

-- ------- quality of life
--
-- Three seams, each wrapped in lib/QoL.lua with the reasoning beside it:
-- OverworldState:interact (A at a tree or the water runs the field move
-- the party menu would have), OverworldState:talkTo (A at a boulder wakes
-- STRENGTH), and BattleState:drawTextArea (effectiveness markers on the
-- move menu, from the same TypeChart the damage formula reads).

-- ------- three more mercies on the same row
--
-- The box that fills up (the PC follows the catch, and a full box rolls
-- forward instead of refusing a deposit), the bag sorted into pockets, and
-- RENAME on the party submenu. Every one of them rides a hook or an event
-- the engine already put there -- pokemon.caught, ui.list_menu,
-- ui.party.submenu -- plus two constructor wraps for the two menus that
-- have no hook of their own. lib/Comforts.lua holds the reasoning.
Comforts.install(mod)

-- ------- and experience for the whole team
--
-- battle.exp_award, whose own comment in the engine names this exact case.
-- Nothing here computes experience: the engine hands over the helper it
-- uses itself, and this only decides who it is called for.
ExpShare.install(mod)

-- Two more of its mercies ride engine HOOKS rather than wraps, because the
-- engine put hooks exactly where they were needed.
--
-- `movement.speed` exists, in the engine's own words, for "running shoes,
-- dash, etc." -- so holding B to jog goes through the front door. next()
-- first, so a mod loaded before this one that already changed the pace keeps
-- its answer and this only ever takes the faster of the two.
mod.hooks:wrap("movement.speed", function(next, frames, ctx)
  return QoL.runSpeed(next(frames, ctx), ctx)
end)

-- And `evolution.check` is the seam for cancelling or forcing any evolution,
-- which is what a trade evolution on a single machine needs: Kadabra,
-- Machoke, Graveler and Haunter evolve by trade and by nothing else, so four
-- species are simply absent from a solo game. next() FIRST and its yes is
-- final -- a real link trade still evolves them the instant it completes, and
-- this only ever adds a second way in.
mod.hooks:wrap("evolution.check", function(next, game, mon, evo, trigger)
  return QoL.tradeEvolution(next(game, mon, evo, trigger),
                            game, mon, evo, trigger)
end)

-- ------- the auto-farm bot
--
-- One seam of its own -- MoveLearnMenu:enter, where the forget-a-move
-- prompt would otherwise wait for a player who is not driving -- wrapped in
-- lib/AutoFarm.lua with the reasoning beside it. Everything else the bot
-- does goes through the engine's own front door: synthetic presses on the
-- same Input queue the tests and drivers write, which is why every menu,
-- message and battle behaves exactly as if a very fast player were at the
-- keys.
AutoFarm.install()

-- The bot's tick rides `input.step`, the boundary Game:step runs for
-- exactly this class of mod -- "before Input:step promotes queued edges so
-- a button chosen here is visible to this logic tick". next() first, so an
-- accessibility driver or another autoplay mod loaded before this one
-- still gets its buttons in ahead of ours.

-- The blind roll, switched off exactly where this feature has replaced it.
--
-- encounter.roll is the engine's own seam for it (OverworldState:rollEncounter
-- offers every wild pick to this chain and takes nil for "nothing this
-- step"), so no encounter code is touched -- and next() is not called at all
-- on the terrain we cover, which leaves the vanilla RNG draws unspent rather
-- than rolling and discarding.
--
-- Answered per TERRAIN, not per map: `covers` is only true for ground this
-- feature has actually stood something on, so a map with no encounter table,
-- no room, or art that would not bake keeps the dice it has always had. The
-- one thing worse than a blind encounter is no encounter.

-- the ghost rule, the Safari menu, the battle itself -- goes on reading the
-- answer rather than the question.
--
-- This is the path for MIX and for OFF, the two rungs where the dice are
-- still being thrown, so a player who never switched the visible Pokemon on
-- gets the same world. Under ROAM the roll above already returned nil on
-- the terrain this mod covers, so this is never reached there -- the tilt
-- happened when the roamer was placed, in the open, which is the whole
-- point of that row.
--
-- next() first and only then decorated, so a mod that replaces the species
-- outright still has the last word on WHICH creature; this only ever moves
