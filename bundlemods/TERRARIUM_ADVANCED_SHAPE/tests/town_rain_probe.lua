-- Probe: the town empties when it rains, and fills back up when it stops.
--
-- Both halves have to be counted, and the second one is the half that
-- matters. "The street is empty" is not a claim a screenshot settles: an
-- empty street and a street whose people this mod has permanently deleted
-- look exactly the same, and only one of them is the feature. So every
-- number here is taken THREE times -- dry, wet, and dry again -- and the
-- test is that the third reading matches the first.
--
-- What is checked, and what each one would be hiding if it were not:
--
--   the CAST SIZE (#ow.npcs).  Must never change. Nothing here delists a map
--   NPC, on purpose -- the engine's scripts find people by walking that list
--   (npcByIndex), so a sheltering NPC that left it is a story that breaks on
--   a rainy Tuesday. If this number ever moves, that rule has been broken.
--
--   WHERE the civilians are standing. Under a shower they should be ON door
--   cells; before and after, on the cells the map authored. A count of who
--   is on a door is the whole feature in one integer.
--
--   the TRAINERS and the STAY objects. Must not move and must not turn. This
--   is the guard rail: a trainer's facing is their line of sight, and a
--   shopkeeper standing where the map put them is the map's authorship.
--
--   the STREET POKEMON. These DO leave -- they are this mod's own and no
--   script has heard of them -- so the count goes to zero under the shower
--   and comes back after it. A count that stays zero afterwards is a
--   spawner this probe caught still being held.
--
--   CONVERSATIONS. Two civilians facing each other, which is the routine
--   beat worth having. Counted rather than looked at for the usual reason:
--   one frame of two people talking and one frame of two people who happen
--   to be pointed at each other are the same picture.
