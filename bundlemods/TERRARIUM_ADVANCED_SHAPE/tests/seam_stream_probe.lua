-- Probe: how long the loading is VISIBLE when the area changes, in frames.
--
-- "The loading shows" is two different pictures, out of two different lines
-- of code, and only one of them is sky:
--
--   NO TERRAIN.  VoxelScene.render returns nil when prefetch could not hand
--   it a mesh for the CURRENT map, and main.lua draws the frame through the
--   ordinary 2D path instead. Not a blank screen -- the game flipping out
--   of 3D and back.
--
--   A HOLE.  The 3D pass ran, but nbMesh[i] was nil for a neighbour, so
--   nothing was drawn at that offset and the full-screen sky clear shows
--   through. THIS is the flat sky.
--
-- A hole only counts when the CAMERA CAN SEE IT. Most connections are on
-- the side of a map you are not looking at (VoxelScene's own note on
-- bounds), and counting those makes a queue that is merely busy look like a
-- world that is broken -- which is how an earlier run of this probe
-- reported two seconds of "sky" for gaps that were off screen the whole
-- time. Visibility is tested with VoxelScene.bounds, the same box the draw
-- culls against, so a hole counted here is a hole that was drawn.
--
-- Nothing is read off a screenshot: the measurement hooks
-- VoxelScene.prefetch and records the two values the draw itself was
-- handed. Screenshots are taken at the first offending frame of each phase,
-- to confirm WHICH picture the number describes, never to be the evidence.
--
-- ------- how the before and after are kept honest
--
-- Both are measured in ONE run, by wrapping ChunkMesher so the OLD
-- behaviour can be put back at will:
--
--   the HOLE priority tier is stripped back to idle, and
--   `covered` is recomputed with the old stack-only test, which could
--   never be true during a warp.
--
-- Run separately, the second phase would inherit whatever queue the first
-- one left behind -- which is exactly how a previous round of this probe
-- produced a "warp got worse" that was really "the warp started dirtier".
-- So every phase invalidates the whole cache first and then settles to a
-- known state, and OLD and NEW run the same phase from the same start.
