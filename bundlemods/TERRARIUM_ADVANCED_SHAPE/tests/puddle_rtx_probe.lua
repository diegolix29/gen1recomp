-- Probe: does a PUDDLE reflect, and does it move while it rains.
--
-- The bug this exists for was invisible in exactly the way a screenshot
-- cannot settle. The reflection was being computed, marched, hit and mixed
-- in -- every stage of it worked -- at a strength of about a tenth, under a
-- decal drawn at ninety percent alpha. So the row did its job, cost its
-- milliseconds, and produced a puddle indistinguishable from one with the
-- row switched off. "It does not reflect" and "it reflects at a twelfth of
-- the pixel" are the same picture and they are not the same bug.
--
-- So this probe does two things a screenshot cannot:
--
--   it PRINTS THE NUMBER.  The Fresnel term is arithmetic on the camera
--   angle and nothing else, so the share of the pixel a reflection is
--   allowed can be worked out here, per camera rung, and written down. A
--   regression in it is then a diff rather than an argument about a picture.
--
--   it SHOOTS THE PAIR.  Same map, same cell, same hour, same shower, RTX
--   OFF and RTX RT -- because the only honest test of "the reflection is
--   visible" is whether you can tell the two apart.
--
-- And then the same pair at every camera rung, because the whole failure was
-- that it DID work at 75 degrees, which is the rung nobody plays at.
