-- Overworld art for a wild Pokemon, out of the art the game already has.
--
-- Gen 1 draws no Pokemon on the map.  Eleven species have an overworld
-- sheet because a script stands one somewhere (the Vermilion Machop, the
-- Snorlax, Bill's Pikachu); the other hundred and forty have exactly one
-- drawing each and it is the battle FRONT pic.  So that is what a roamer
-- wears, resampled down to the 16x16 cell every other character on the map
-- occupies.
--
-- Baked to a real 16x96 sheet on disk rather than kept as a canvas in
-- memory, and that is the whole reason this file exists.  A sheet at a PATH
-- is a sprite the ENGINE understands: SpriteRenderer loads it, the OBP bake
-- recolors it, the SGB zone shader colors it out of the map's own palette,
-- the voxel pass cuts its card from it, the sun pass throws its silhouette.
-- Every one of those is keyed on the image path.  An Image conjured at
-- runtime would have needed each of them taught about it; a file needs none
-- of them touched.
--
-- Baked once and kept: the sheet lands under the engine's own derived-asset
-- root (save/mod-derived/<id>/), where a hot reload and an uninstall already
-- know to look, and the revision in each filename means a change to this
-- generator supersedes what an older cut left there rather than being
-- mistaken for it.
--
-- Better art wins outright.  A sheet shipped in the mod's own
-- assets/roamers/<SPECIES>.png is used as-is and nothing is generated, so a
-- pixel artist can replace one species, or all of them, without touching a
-- line of this.
