-- Voxel world mode: the day/night cycle -- one clock, and everything the
-- frame asks it.
--
-- THE CLOCK is twenty minutes around: ten of day, ten of night. The DAYTIME
-- row either PINS it -- DAY, NIGHT, DUSK and DAWN are fixed times on that
-- dial, not separate looks -- or lets it run (CYCLE), in which case the pin
-- the player left is where the cycle picks up. Everything below is a pure
-- function of the clock, so the pinned settings and the running cycle can
-- never drift apart: DUSK is simply the cycle stopped at sunset.
--
-- THE SUN's noon is this mod's existing sun, exactly: shear (-0.85, -0.55),
-- hanging in the southeast about 45 degrees up. That is the DAY setting and
-- the default, so a player who never touches the row sees the mod they
-- already had. From there the arc swings NORTH at both ends -- rising 70
-- degrees north of east, setting the mirror of that -- because the camera
-- looks north and the northern sky is the only sky it ever frames: a sun
-- that rose due east would light the world for ten minutes without once
-- being seen. Swung north, the disc stands in frame through dawn and dusk
-- (the hours worth looking at) and passes overhead-behind-the-camera
-- through midday, which is where a noon sun belongs.
--
-- THE MOON arcs entirely through the northern sky -- rising northeast, due
-- north at mid-night, setting northwest -- so it hangs over the diorama all
-- night and the pinned NIGHT setting puts it dead centre. Its shadows fall
-- softly south, away from it, at about two-thirds the sun's weight.
--
-- SHADOWS are the shear the light throws: direction opposite the body's
-- bearing, length its elevation's cotangent (clamped -- a rising sun throws
-- a long shadow, not an infinite one), strength fading to nothing over the
-- last twelve degrees before the horizon so the handoff between sun and
-- moon is a soft gap rather than a snap. Face shading (Voxel3D.FACE_SHADE)
-- deliberately stays the noon bake: it is a subtle angle term baked into
-- every mesh, and rebaking the world's geometry per phase buys less than
-- the cast shadows, the sky and the tint already say.
--
-- OUTDOOR ONLY. Indoors keeps the noon rig, the untinted world and no sky:
-- a cave at midnight is exactly as dark as a cave at noon, which is what a
-- room with no windows looks like. Map.isOutdoor is the same test the sky
-- already rests on; the caller passes its answer in (applyRig/tint).
--
-- Persistence: the running cycle's clock is written into the mod's own
-- save-file bucket (save.modData.<mod.id>, via mod.save) on the
-- engine's save.writing event, and read back on save.loaded/created. A save
-- with no clock in it starts at noon.

-- away to infinity as the sun reaches the horizon and something has to hold
-- it, or a lamp post throws a shadow across the whole map.
--
-- It is 1/tan(FADE_DEG) exactly, and that is the whole derivation. Below
-- FADE_DEG degrees `strengthAt` is already fading the shadow out; at
-- 1/tan(FADE_DEG) the clamp cannot engage until the sun is inside that
-- window. So the clamp can only ever shorten a shadow that is ALREADY on
-- its way to nothing, which is precisely what a backstop should do.
--
-- It used to be 2.0, and 2.0 is 1/tan(26.6 deg) -- more than twice as high
-- in the sky as the fade. Measured a second at a time over the cycle, that
-- clamp was active for 520 of 1200 seconds, and for 300 OF THOSE THE SHADOW
-- WAS AT FULL STRENGTH: five minutes of every twenty spent cutting a
-- shadow the player was looking at, right through the golden hour, which is
-- the one time of day a long raking shadow is the entire point. At 4.7 that
-- number is 2 seconds.
--
-- WHAT IT COSTS, measured rather than assumed (tests/shadow_length_probe):
-- not frame time. The caster set is Quality's business, not the frustum's,
-- so a longer shadow adds no draws -- the palindrome at the worst hour came
-- back at +0.015 ms, +0.1%, on a run whose same-K spread was 1.2%. What it
-- costs is SHARPNESS, through ShadowMap.fit's `reach`, which widens the
-- light frustum onto a fixed texel budget. At the default LOW rung the
-- worst hour goes from 1.247 to 1.425 world pixels per shadow texel, +14%.
-- At HIGH -- already on the top rung, so it cannot buy its way out by
-- stepping up the ladder -- it goes 0.468 to 0.712, +52%, which sounds much
-- worse than it looks: both are still UNDER one world pixel per texel, so

-- both longer and DEEPER. That is the half of "late afternoon" that length
-- alone does not buy.
--

-- ------- the palettes
--
-- Sky bands, lightest FIRST (the horizon end), exactly the shape Sky.bands
-- reads. Six bands, not four: twilight is the whole show here, and six rungs
-- of it is what keeps a sunset reading as a gradient rather than as stripes.
-- Every channel is a multiple of 8 -- the 5-bit GBC lattice -- including
-- after blending, which re-quantises onto it.
-- `golden` and `violet` are not pins -- the DAYTIME menu cannot stop on
-- them -- but they are not mere waypoints either: the dial below holds each
-- of them, because a palette that is only ever passed THROUGH is a palette
-- nobody sees. What they exist for is the blend: day's blue horizon and
-- dusk's gold one are near-complements, and a straight lerp between
-- complements bottoms out in grey -- mid-transition the whole sky went the
-- colour of dishwater, and gold-to-navy did the same on the far side of
-- sunset. So the evening bends through a golden hour (horizon warming,
-- zenith still blue -- late afternoon), and both edges of the night bend
-- through a violet civil twilight (rose horizon under a violet sky -- the
-- real colour of that half hour).
--
-- The MORNING uses the same golden. It was left out originally on the
-- grounds that dawn's pinks and day's blues share a family and blend clean
-- without help -- which is true, and beside the point: the reason to put a
-- golden hour after sunrise is not that the blend needs rescuing, it is
-- that the hour is there in the world and the palette for it was already
-- written. Sunrise now runs dawn -> golden -> day, mirroring the evening's
-- day -> golden -> dusk, which is also the order the real sky does it in.

--
-- The stratus above is deliberately NEUTRAL, and that argument is still right
-- for an ordinary shower: what says "it is raining" is the loss of blue, not
-- the loss of light. It is wrong for the shower that throws lightning. A
-- storm cell is not a darker grey -- it is BRUISED, and the colour it bruises
-- toward is violet, because what is left under it is skylight that has come
-- through a mile of water.
--
-- So this is a SECOND register rather than a replacement. `storm` only leaves
-- zero above Weather.STRIKE_ABOVE -- the same gate that arms the lightning --
-- so a drizzle stays exactly the grey it has always been, and the sky that
-- goes purple is the sky that can flash. That pairing is learnable in two
-- storms and it costs nothing to teach.

-- The dial as keyframes: a repeated name is a PLATEAU, a change is a ramp
-- between the two.
--
-- ------- why every phase gets a plateau
--
-- The dial this replaces named all six phases and held only two of them.
-- Measured over the cycle a second at a time, `day` held full weight for
-- 376s and `night` for 451s -- and `dawn`, `golden` and `dusk` for ONE
-- second each, `violet` for none at all. Sixty-nine per cent of the cycle
-- was one of two flat colours and the other four palettes were only ever
-- crossed. That is not a subtle mistuning: four sets of six hand-quantised
-- rungs, the glow colours, the lamp curve and the cloud weights were all
-- being paid for and never painted. A screenshot could not show it, because
-- every frame it produced was a defensible blend of two real palettes.
--
-- So the keyframes below are laid out to give each phase a plateau it is
-- actually held at, on a fifteen-second grid (a fifth of BLEND -- the
-- coarsest step on which every edge here lands whole):
--
--     dawn      0 ->   45      45s   sun on the horizon, glowing
--     golden   120 ->  195     75s   the morning warm hour (new)
--     day      270 ->  420    150s   noon proper
--     golden   465 ->  525     60s   late afternoon
--     dusk     555 ->  600     45s   ending exactly at sunset
--     violet   645 ->  705     60s   civil twilight
--     night    780 -> 1020    240s   the moon's own hours
--     violet  1095 -> 1140     45s   the far side of the night
--
-- with the ramps taking the rest. Two constraints shape it and neither may
-- be given up:
--
-- THE PINS STAY WHERE THEY ARE. DayNight.T is unchanged, so SYNC still maps
-- the wall clock the way it did and a save still restores to the same sky.
-- Each of the four pinned times now lands INSIDE its own phase's plateau
-- rather than on a one-second spike: choosing DUSK in the menu hands the
-- player the dusk palette, which is what the row always claimed to do.
--
-- DUSK ENDS AT THE SUN, NOT ACROSS IT. The plateau closes exactly on
