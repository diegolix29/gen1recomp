-- ------- combo-package note
--
-- This file is ADVANCED_SHAPE's own main.lua (formerly upstream
-- DRAMATIC_SHAPE), unmodified apart from four purely mechanical changes so
-- it can share a package with TERRARIUM without their files colliding on
-- disk:
--
--   1. chunkFor/V.require/V.data below read from lib_dramatic/ and
--      data_dramatic/ instead of lib/ and data/, since TERRARIUM ships its
--      OWN, differently-written files under those same names (the two
--      forks diverged well past main.lua -- Water.lua, Voxel3D.lua and
--      several others are genuinely different modules per fork) and only
--      one file can sit at a given path.
--   2. lib_dramatic/ShinyPalette.lua's one direct data lookup is repointed
--      from data/shiny_colors.lua to data_dramatic/shiny_colors.lua for
--      the same reason -- it bypasses V.data and reads V.path directly.
--   3. Three guard flags this file sets on shared ENGINE classes --
--      Map.advanced_blockHook, OptionsMenu.advanced_fullHook and
--      OverworldState.advanced_selectHook -- are renamed to
--      advanced_blockHook / advanced_fullHook / advanced_selectHook.
--      TERRARIUM inherited the first two flag NAMES from the same common
--      ancestor; sharing a package now means whichever mod's main.lua ran
--      first would set the flag and the second would read it already
--      true, silently skipping its own hook install.
--   4. mod.exports.version/lib/pipelines/keys, at the bottom, write into a
--      namespaced mod.exports.dramatic table instead of the flat fields,
--      since TERRARIUM's main.lua sets those same four flat fields.
--
-- Every line of actual mod logic below -- every pipeline, hook, setting
-- and hotkey -- is untouched.

-- Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod: a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as a
-- rendering pipeline mod.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Voxel mode is presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.  TWO rungs are the deliberate exception. 1ST
-- (the camera in the player's own eyes) and 3RD (the same rig, boomed back
-- behind their shoulder) replace the grid WALK with a free,
-- camera-relative one while either is selected (lib/FreeMove.lua), because
-- a camera you can steer with a mouse demands feet that go where it looks.
-- Even there the game is untouched: the walk asks the engine's own
-- collision the same questions a grid step asks, keeps the player's
-- logical cell synced, and fires the engine's own landing pipeline per
-- cell crossed -- warps, encounters, ledges, gates and scripts all run
-- exactly as themselves. Step off the rung and the grid walk is back.

--   5  V-GRID   toggle the wireframe         (new)
--   6  T-SHIFT  cycle the blur ladder        (was 9)
--   7  V-CURVE  cycle the horizon bend       (new)
--   8  3D-BTL   cycle overworld battles      (new)
--   9  WATER    cycle the water reflections  (new; 9 was T-SHIFT's old key)
--
-- Only 6 arrives by the documented route. Game:keypressed answers the
-- engine's own display keys FIRST and returns -- 2 COLORS, 3 TILT, 4 ZOOM,
-- 5 GBC FX -- and only then offers the key to Pipelines.hotkey, expressly
-- so "a pipeline can never shadow one" (Schemas, render_pipelines.hotkey).
-- 3 and 5 are two of those, and 7 and 8 belong to plain mod settings that
-- own no pass and so have no registry to claim a key from at all.
--
-- So this wraps Game:keypressed. It is the invasive option and it is the
-- only one: polling the keyboard in update() would fire alongside the
-- engine's handler rather than instead of it, so 3 would cycle this mode
-- AND the engine's TILT on the same press.
--
-- Consequences worth being explicit about: while this mod is enabled, TILT
-- (3) and GBC FX (5) are unreachable by key -- and unreachable on the OPTIONS
-- menu too, where both rows are taken away and both values held at zero (see
-- pinEngineFx). Nothing is being hidden that still does something: TILT is the
-- flat fake of what this mode does for real, the registry already forces it
-- off whenever a world pipeline takes the pass, and GBC FX is a full-screen
-- present pass over the top of the diorama. Uninstalling puts both back.
--
-- Everything the engine does around a pipeline hotkey has to happen here
-- too, so the work is DELEGATED rather than reimplemented: Pipelines.hotkey
-- applies its own gate and ladder, and the three lines after it are the
-- engine's own (syncOptions, the tilt exclusion, writeOptions).

-- ------- the mode's rows, on menus of their own

-- carried twenty engine rows, and finding SHADOWS meant knowing it was in
-- there past the wireframe and the horizon bend.
--
-- Now there is ONE row, and it leads the list. What it opens -- the
-- categories, the screens, and why the split falls where it does -- is
-- lib/SettingsMenu.lua. VOXEL and T-SHIFT go with it: they are this mod's
-- display modes, the engine only spliced them beside TILT because it had
-- nowhere better, and TILT is not on the menu any more anyway (see below).
--
-- Two things it takes to move a pipeline row: the engine's descriptor is
-- captured on the way past and handed to SettingsMenu VERBATIM -- it persists
-- through its own step function into save.options.pipelines, and rebuilding
-- it here would be a second implementation of something the engine already
-- got right -- and the row is then dropped from the top-level list so it is
-- not in two places at once.

-- are taken off the menu rather than left to be changed under it -- including
-- T-SHIFT, which is a pipeline row the engine put there. A row that no longer

end

-- ------- TILT and GBC FX are gone while this mod is installed
--
-- Both fight the diorama, and both were already half-taken: the mode's own key
-- (3) forces them off on every press, and the registry switches TILT off
-- whenever a world pipeline takes the pass. What was left was two rows the
-- player could set and watch get reverted -- TILT is the flat fake of what
-- this mode does for real, and GBC FX is a full-screen present pass over the
-- top of the whole thing.
--
-- So they come OFF the menu, and are HELD at zero rather than merely dropped.
-- Hiding a live setting is a trap: a save written before the mod was installed
-- can carry TILT 3, and a row that is not there is a row that cannot turn it
-- back off. Pinned wherever the value could have arrived from -- the menu
-- opening, a save being loaded or begun -- so there is no route by which one
-- of them is on and unreachable.
--
-- Everything they did is still reachable: uninstall the mod and both rows are
-- back, at whatever they were last set to.
-- BATTLE BG rides the same reasoning, and comes off for a reason of its own.
-- The row picks what fills the screen AROUND the battle's 160x144 field --
-- WHITE paper, BLACK bars, or the frozen overworld dimmed behind it -- and
-- all three were answers to the same question: what to do with the voids,
-- given the battle is a small picture in the middle of a big window.
--
-- This mod answers that question differently and permanently. A staged fight
-- fills the whole window with the map the fight is standing on, and the
-- flat battle screen it composites over it is drawn on the mode's own
-- surface; there are no voids left for the row to fill. WORLD is the worst
-- of the three under it -- it makes the battle non-opaque so the engine
-- draws the overworld underneath, which is a SECOND copy of the world drawn
-- under the one the arena pass already put there, dimmed and at a different
-- camera. BLACK bars over a diorama read as a letterboxed screenshot.
--
-- So the value is pinned at WHITE, which is the one the mode was composed
-- against, and the row comes off the menu on the same reasoning as TILT and
-- GBC FX: a row that no longer decides anything is worse than no row.
-- Uninstall the mod and it is back, at whatever it was last set to.

-- or toggling 3D-BTL, which is the other row that owns one (BATTLE LAYOUT).
-- Every other rung returns the same list, and rebuilding on all of them would
-- rerun every mod's ui.options.rows hook once per keypress. The cursor is
-- clamped rather than reset, so it stays on the row it was just used on
-- instead of jumping to the top when the list below it shortens.
--
-- Held on the INSTANCE rather than compared across one call of update, and
-- that is not a tidying: those three rows live in a SUBMENU now, and the
-- stack only ticks its top state (src/core/StateStack.update). So the step
-- that changes them happens while this menu is suspended and a
-- before/after pair taken around inner() would both be read after the fact
-- and always agree. A signature that outlives the suspension does not.

-- ------- battles on the map
--
-- The wraps this needs -- OverworldState:pushBattle, BattleState:draw and
-- BattleState:drawHUDs -- all live in lib/OverworldBattle.lua, which is
-- where the reasoning for each one is written down. Installed once, here,
-- so this file keeps naming every engine seam the mod touches.
OverworldBattle.install()

-- ------- shiny Pokemon
--
-- ON, always, with no row to switch it off: shininess is a property of the
-- Pokemon rather than a display mode, and a Pokemon that is shiny in one
-- player's save and not another's is not a Pokemon, it is a setting.
--
-- It rests on a fact the engine already ships. Gen 1 has no shininess of its
-- own, but it has the four DVs Gen 2 reads to decide it, and
-- src/pokemon/Stats.lua:90 carries that reading -- the engine's own comment
-- calls it "the RBY virtual shiny" and says it is there for indicator mods.
-- So nothing new is stored on a Pokemon and nothing has to migrate: every
-- save ever made already contains the answer, and this only starts drawing
-- it. See lib/Shiny.lua for why deriving beats storing.
--
-- Three seams, each in its own file with its own reasoning:
--   ShinyBattle  wraps Pokemon.new, which is where every wild, gift,
--                starter and traded mon is built, so the roll lands before
--                the sprite is baked
--   ShinyUI      the battle pics' tint and the status page's mark
--   ShinyFx      the arrival sparkle (armed from Stadium.update)
--
-- The Stadium models need no seam here at all: their recolour happens at
-- extraction (lib/StadiumBuild.lua), and the battle simply asks for the
-- shiny pack.
ShinyBattle.install()
ShinyUI.install()

-- A save opened for the first time under this mod has shiny Pokemon in it
-- already -- they always did -- so refresh the cached flag across the party
-- rather than leaving it absent until each mon next changes.

-- ------- the free-roam rungs' inputs and their walk
--
-- 1ST and 3RD need two things no other rung does, and each is a named seam.
-- Both rungs are one rig -- the boom behind the shoulder is a number inside
-- it (lib/ThirdPerson.lua) -- so both are installed by the same two calls:
--
-- FirstPerson.install claims the LOOK inputs the engine ignores: the right
-- stick's axes (Game:gamepadaxis passes them to Input, which returns early
-- on anything but the left pair), relative mouse motion (love.mousemoved --
-- there is no Game handler to wrap; the engine's own callback only feeds
-- the mouse-as-touch debug path, which stays untouched), the mouse buttons
-- while the cursor is captured (A and B -- there is no cursor to click UI
-- with), and any touch that lands off the overlay's controls (a drag on
-- open screen is the look; the d-pad and buttons still go to
-- TouchControls, whose own d-pad finger is also read back analog as the
-- move vector). Every wrap forwards whatever it does not claim, and claims
-- only while one of the two rungs is actually driving.
--
-- FreeMove.install wraps OverworldState:handleInput -- the one choke point
-- where the grid walk reads the pad, and the same seam the engine's own
-- Cycling Road pull lives behind. While either drives, the walk is continuous
-- and camera-relative; the player's logical cell stays synced and every
-- per-cell consequence still runs through the engine's own machinery
-- (onStepComplete, checkEdgeExit, checkLedgeHop, checkBoulderPush). The
-- file argues the whole arrangement.
FirstPerson.install()
FreeMove.install()

-- ------- the zooms, and the battle camera the player can steer
--
-- CamControl claims the wheel, Q/E, the mouse and the touch screen for
-- whichever camera is actually in front of the player -- the staged
-- battle's, the third-person boom, or the engine's own survey zoom -- and
-- forwards everything else. Installed AFTER the two above deliberately: a
-- wrap installed later is the OUTER one, so a fight gets first refusal on
-- the mouse and the fingers, which is right, because while one is staged
-- the free-roam look is not driving.
CamControl.install()

-- ------- SELECT walks the angle ladder
--
-- The same step the "3" key makes, on the pad's own button: a phone (and
-- a controller) has no number row, and SELECT has no overworld job in
-- Gen 1 -- its work is all in-menu, which this wrap never sees. The seam
-- is OverworldState:handleInput, the same choke point the free walk
-- replaced: every gate above it -- menus, dialogs, scripted moves,
-- transitions -- already decided the overworld owns the buttons, so a
-- SELECT here is free-roam by construction, exactly like the key. When
-- the step is refused (mid-warp, no 3D pass) the press falls through to
-- the engine's own handling, which is a no-op, as ever.
--
-- Installed AFTER FreeMove.install, deliberately: its wrap must sit
-- OUTSIDE the free walk's, or first person -- where FreeMove.tick takes
-- the frame and never calls further in -- would eat the button, and the
-- one rung SELECT could not step off of would be 1ST itself.

-- ------- the konami code, and everything it turns on
--

-- handleInput at all -- it reads the fixed step's own press queue, which
-- is where keyboard, pad, touch and the VR controllers have all already
-- become the same eight buttons. See lib/Horde.lua.
Horde.install()

-- ------- LET'S GO capture mode
--
-- After every other input seam on purpose: while a throw is being aimed
-- the capture's mouse and touch wraps are the OUTERMOST, so the flick is
-- read before anything else can claim the pointer -- and outside the aim
-- they forward every byte untouched. The battle-side wraps (throwBall,
-- safariAction) and the experience hooks install here too.
LetsGo.install()

-- ------- edge-anchored menus stay in the GB frame while a headset is live
--
-- First-person mode replaces the grid walk with free camera-relative movement.

-- the 1ST rung is active and walk the player by collision rather than grid cells.
FreeMove.install()

-- The overworld's own pushBattle is the choke point for a wild encounter or
-- a trainer, and it is wrapped. A battle that arrives some other way -- a

-- needs no battle code at all -- and every path that builds a battler goes
